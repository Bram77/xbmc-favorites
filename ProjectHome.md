### From now on the log can be viewed [here](http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-favorites/source/browse/logs/updates.txt) so the front page doesn't fill up so fast. ###

### Introduction ###

This is a personal selection of the best plugins, skins and scripts for XBMC.
I'll try to keep the files as up to date as possible.
The [XBMC-Favorites Installer](http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-favorites/downloads/list) plugin is a slightly modified version of the [XBMC-Addons Installer](http://xbmc-addons.googlecode.com).

### Available addons ###

Just take a look at [this](http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-favorites/source/browse/trunk)...

### Notes ###

**!! Important !!**

  * The "**Project Mayhem III**" skin available does not overwrite your current skin. It will only provide three new themes to choose from within you're current skin version.
  * The "**Dutch Radiostreams**" Music plugin (it actually isn't a plugin, just a collection of streams) should be added to the Music section as a location, even though it's downloaded to the "plugins/music/" directory on your XBOX.

### Todo ###

  * Add an option to update all plugins with one click

NONE OF THESE PLUGINS, SKINS AND SCRIPT ARE MADE BY ME! ALL CREDITS GO TO THE ORIGINAL AUTOHORS! ALSMOST ALL OF THEM ARE NON-FINALS/DEVELOPMENT VERSIONS!
