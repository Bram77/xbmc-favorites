_A lot of video plugins require the veohproxy script to be running, so it's nice to have the script starting automatically. Below instructions on how to do that._

= Introduction =

Once downloaded, your "scripts/veohproxy/" directory will contain a "autoexec.py" file. If you place this file in the root of the "scripts/" direcotry it will automatically start the script on XBMC boot.

= Download =

You can download the autoexec.py file by right clicking and selecting "Save target as..." on [http://xbmc-favorites.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scripts/autoexec.py this] link.


= Instructions =

  * FTP to your XBOX (take a look at the [http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-favorites/wiki/Installation Installation wiki] to find out how to do this)
  * Navigate to the XBMC-scripts directory. This usually is "E/XBMC/scripts".
  * You'll find the "veohproxy' directory there. Enter it and copy the "autoexec.py" file present.
  * Move one directory up (to "E/XBMC/scripts/") and paste the file there.
  * Reboot your XBOX. Once XBMC is running, the "veohproxy" script will be running too.
