01/12/2009 - MythBox SVN 682
============================
 - Split out README instructions for Windows/Linux requirements and installation
 - Windows now requires XBMC SVN Trunk
 - Added 64bit _mysql.so to libs
 - ffmpeg executable added to Settings -> Paths
 - Launching ffmpeg on Windows is problematic because python doesn't have 
   a console w/ attached stdin to pass to child process. Comm skipping and
   bookmarking won't work on windows until resolved.
