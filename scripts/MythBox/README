What is MythBox?
================
MythBox is a MythTV frontend for XBMC. 

It runs as a XBMC script (not a plugin) and has the following major features:
- watch livetv
- watch recordings (w/ comm skip)
- schedule recordings 


History
================
MythBox was forked from xbmc-mythtv (http://xbmc-mythtv.sourceforge.net) 
and heavily modified to bring MythTV protocol support up to date, 
add new features, and make MythTV a pleasure to use in XBMC (obviously, not there yet).
Many thanks to all the developers whose time and effort went into the original 
xbmc-mythtv project!


Requirements
================
  
  All Platforms
  --------------
  - MythTV backend 0.21 or 0.22 (trunk)
  - MythTV recordings directory accessible via the local filesystem
    (nfs, samba, whatever you prefer). Not an issue if you're running
    XBMC on your MythTV backend machine. 

  Linux
  -------------
  - XBMC Atlantis 8.10 or later running on 32bit Linux, preferably Ubuntu. 
  - ffmpeg installed (sudo apt-get install ffmpeg)
  - python bindings for mysql (sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb)

    http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php

First Milestone -  
===============

    GOAL
    ----------------
    - Get most of the core functionality working.
    - Watching livetv
    - Watching recording + commercial skipping
    - Scheduling recordings  
    - Defer complete overhaul of the GUI to future releases.
    - Usable enough to replace mythtv frontend for most tasks
    - Solicit feedback for changes/new features/etc.
    
    DONE
    ----------------
    - Recordings resume where you left off (mythtv bookmarks feature)
    - Replace logging subsystem. Mythbox specific logging goes to mythbox.log. 
    - Commercial skipping (can be off a little if xbmc does not play video at framerate specified in mpeg file)
    - Support for commercial skipping via EDL skip files (broken in xbmc - TODO: Add issue # from trac)
    - MySQL 4.1+ client support
    - Switch over to the mysql python client that uses the native libmysql shared lib
    - 12 hour AM/PM time format for TV guide headers
    - Get LiveTV working
    - move generated images/thumbs to script_data/<scriptname>/images/thumbs
    - Remove mythtv_statusport, mythtv_startpage, mythtv_recplayer, mythtv_recordlive, mythtv_recordlength settings
    - Move settings.xml to userdata/script_data/<script_name> directory
    - Recording details screen thumbnail now respects image aspect ratio
    - Support for multiple recording directories (maps to MythTV recording groups)
    - Enable unit tests to be run w/o hardcoded config info (util.OnDemandConfig)
    - Remove use of singletons (singleton.py)
    - fix livetv/recorded tv player callback issue - induced GC so callbacks get unregistered
    - Added support for MythTV 0.22 (SVN trunk) - set <mythtv_version_override> in settings.xml
    - Fresh install works w/o an existing settings.xml
    - get a decect icon
    - TV Guide usable
    - LiveTV progress dialog
    
    TODO
    --------------
    - Fix scheduling recordings from TV guide 
    - move tv channel icon thumbs to script_data/<scriptname>/images/channels - remove from svn
    - fix pyxcoder parsing failures on nuppelvids
    - Get settings via myth protocol instead of db
    - maybe..Samba support (so MythTV recordings dir doesn't have to be accessible via filesystem)
    - Get rid of settings for mythbackend hostname and port. These values can be queried from the settings tables
      as MasterServerIP and MasterServerPort
    - Would be cool to have an RSS feed of the latest MythTV news using RSS Feed control
      http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=Controls#Available_controls
    - Would be cool to have playing video (mini version) on all screens if player is playing
      http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=Controls#Available_controls  
    - Configurable 'Confirm on Delete'


Future plans
=============
- Complete re-write of UI to use WindowXML (skinners/gfx help needed)
- Verify works on Windows
- Verify works on MacOSX
- Standalone python bindings for MythTV
- TV show fanart scraper
- MythTV RSS feeds


Development Changes
=====================
- Unit tests rule (real time saver - especially for a dynamic language)
- Dependency injection/IOC where possible
- Mocking support (mockito rocks!)
- Improve pydocs
- Re-orged/renamed lot of stuff to follow AMT structure


What if it doesn't work?
==========================
Grab the log file (~/mythbox.log) 
and open up a defect @ http://code.google.com/p/mythbox/issues/list.

A description of your setup and steps to reproduce are
essential. 

My ability to fix things depends in a large
part on your ability to provide as much information as 
possible to isolate and reproduce the problem :-)

Additional nuggets of goodness:
- Tweak log levels in ~/.xbmc/scripts/MythBox/mythbox_log.ini
- Tweak settings manually in ~/.xbmc/userdata/script_data/MythBox/settings.xml
