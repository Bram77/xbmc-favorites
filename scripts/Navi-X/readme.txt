Welcome to Navi-X v2.5

Changelog:

Files are automatically added to the download queue. You can resume your downloads the next 
time you start Navi-X by using the options in  the download queue menu.

2. Multi threading suppport for better performance and stability. E.g. thumbnail images 
are now downloaded and processed from a separate thread.

update date of the specific item. When this attribute is set Navi-X will automatically
mark the item as new. This feature will make it a lot easier to find new content.

5. Solved other minor problems.

Enjoy.

Navi-X is tested using the T3CH build. If you are having problems
and are using a different XBMC then please let me know. Thanks.

-----------------
Navi-X is a media browser which allows you to browse and play video files, audio files, 
show images and shows text files. Navi-X can be compared with a web browser but it uses 
PLX playlists files instead of HTML files. Like web pages PLX-files can be located 
anywhere on the internet but they can also be located locally on your Xbox. 

Navi-X allows people to create their own playlists without having to know how to develop 
a Python script. PLX Playlist are simple text files and can be edited with any text editor 
like notepad (see below for the formatting). Playlist can also link to other playlist 
which is similar to HTML files.

Navi-X allows people to share and manage their own playlists. For example a user can 
develop a playlist and upload it to a HTTP server. Many people already have a 
personal website. Just upload the playlist to your website and share the link 
with others. Changes made to your playlists will be visible to others immediately.
