-----------------
Navi-X is a media browser which allows you to browse and play video files, audio files, 
show images and shows text files. Navi-X can be compared with a web browser but it uses 
PLX playlists files instead of HTML files. Like web pages PLX-files can be located 
anywhere on the internet but they can also be located locally on your Xbox. 

Navi-X allows people to create their own playlists without having to know how to develop 
a Python script. PLX Playlist are simple text files and can be edited with any text editor 
like notepad (see below for the formatting). Playlist can also link to other playlist 
which is similar to HTML files.

Navi-X allows people to share and manage their own playlists. For example a user can 
develop a playlist and upload it to a HTTP server. Many people already have a 
personal website. Just upload the playlist to your website and share the link 
with others. Changes made to your playlists will be visible to others immediately.
